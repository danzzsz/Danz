<td>WE DID IT

61

We are thrilled to announce that our school has emerged as the DIVISION CHAMPION in the Junior High School Category of the NESTLÉ WELLNESS CAMPUS BEST IMPLEMENTING SCHOOL for SY 2024-2025!

This achievement would not have been possible without the hard work, dedication, and teamwork of our students, teachers, and staff. We are proud of each and every one of you!

Thank you to Nestlé Philippines for recognizing our efforts in promoting wellness and healthy habits in our school community.</td>

<td>Excited to share our experience at the Hands on Manila interschool activity, "Wear it Wisely," held at Taguig Integrated School on April 5, 2025!
We explored the world of sustainable fashion design, learning how to express our creativity while caring for our planet.
Together, we're redefining style with purpose!
<td>Bullying has no place in our schools, in our hearts, and in our community.

As the new school year starts, we stand together with one voice, one mission, and one goal - to create a safe and caring environment for every student. Through the Anti-Bullying and Child Protection Policy Campaign, we are reminded that no act of kindness is ever too small and no voice is ever too quiet when it speaks against injustice.</td></tr></table></center>
